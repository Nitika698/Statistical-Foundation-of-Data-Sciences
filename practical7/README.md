# Practical 7 - Statistical Analysis

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project contains statistical analysis of teacher rating data using Python. The analysis explores relationships between gender, age, beauty scores, and teaching evaluation ratings.

## ðŸŽ¯ Analysis Objectives
1. **Gender Impact Analysis**: Examine if gender affects teaching evaluation scores using regression and t-tests
2. **Age Group Comparison**: Analyze if beauty scores differ across age groups using ANOVA
3. **Correlation Study**: Investigate relationship between beauty scores and teaching evaluations

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- Gender shows statistically significant effect on evaluation ratings
- Beauty scores vary significantly across different age groups
- Positive correlation exists between beauty scores and teaching evaluations

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Open `teacher_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. View results and visualizations in the notebook

## ðŸ“š Libraries Used
- pandas: Data manipulation
- statsmodels: Statistical modeling
- scipy: Statistical tests
- matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization
