#  Statistics Practical 2 — Teachers Rating Data

##  Overview

This practical focuses on identifying data types and performing statistical analysis using a simulated dataset called **Teachers Rating Data**. The work demonstrates the difference between *time series* and *cross-sectional* data and applies various statistical methods to understand data behavior and relationships.

## 🎯 Key Points (with short descriptions)

* **Data Type Identification** → Determine whether the given dataset represents time series or cross-sectional data.
* **Random Dataset Creation** → Generate a random dataset to represent teacher profiles with different characteristics.
* **Descriptive Statistics** → Calculate measures like mean, median, and standard deviation to summarize data.
* **Outlier Detection** → Identify unusual or extreme data points that affect results.
* **Visualization** → Use graphs and charts to interpret relationships and patterns in the dataset.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python** → Programming language used for the analysis.
* **NumPy** → For performing numerical operations.
* **Pandas** → For creating and managing the dataset.
* **Matplotlib** → For visualizing the data.
* **Random** → For generating random samples in the dataset.

## 📈 Observations

* The **Teachers Rating Data** is a **cross-sectional dataset** because it captures data for multiple entities (teachers) at a single point in time.
* Summary statistics help understand central tendencies and variation among attributes.
* Visual representations make it easier to identify relationships between variables such as beauty and rating.
